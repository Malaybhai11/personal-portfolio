              I'm Malay Raval, a passionate car enthusiast with an unshakable love for high-performance machines, especially BMWs like the M5 CS and 230i. Cars aren't just a hobby for me—they're an obsession. I admire the engineering behind them, from the roar of a powerful engine to the precision of a perfect drift.

              Beyond my love for cars, I'm a tech explorer, currently pursuing a diploma in computer engineering at Government Polytechnic College, Jamnagar. I enjoy coding, mainly in Python, and have successfully tackled projects like Instagram automation using Selenium. I prefer a structured, step-by-step approach to learning—whether it's programming, app development, or automotive concepts.
